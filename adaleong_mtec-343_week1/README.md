# Week 1 Reading Homework

1. What I didn't know
- While I knew there were live coders for music, I didn't realize there were more for other arts too such as dance, poetry, and other forms of media
- I did not know how often live coders worked together, or how important collaboration and experimentation is.


2. What I already knew
- I always knew that software was intertwined with our daily lives! This also makes sense because of the amount of jobs that require software being used, and how often things are digitized.
- The book mentions that there is no universal language to code in, which makes sense! There are so many coding languages out there for different purposes.
- Coming into this class, I already had an idea of what live coding was - interacting and writing with software in real time. I like that they used the term "thinking in public."
